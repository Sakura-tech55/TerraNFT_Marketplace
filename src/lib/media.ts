/* ============================================================
   Artwork URLs.

   Asset files are not public. Every image in the UI is requested
   through /api/media/<id>, which decides what the viewer may see
   (watermarked preview vs clean image) — see that route.

   Always pass `unoptimized` to next/image for these: Next's image
   optimizer fetches the URL from the server without the viewer's
   cookie, so it would cache a watermarked preview for everyone.
